*Prep Time: 10 min*<br>
*Cook Time: 30 min +/-*

### Ingredients:  
|Ingredients | US    |Metric |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Very ripe bananas | 2, or approx. 1 + 1/3 cups | N/A |
| All purpose flour (sifted) | 1 + 1/2 cups | TBA |
| Eggs | 2 (large) | N/A |
| Sugar | 1 cup | TBA |
| Baking soda | 1 tsp | TBA |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp | TBA |
| Unsalted butter | 1 stick (1/2 cup) | N/A |
| Chocolate chips (see note 1) | 1/2 bag, or as desired | N/A |
| Vanilla extract | A dash (optional) | N/A |

### Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375° F, 190° C (see note 2).

2. Soften the butter in a small bowl in the microwave.

3. Peel the bananas and break them into chunks.

4. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, blend the banana chunks and salt until most of the banana chunks are gone and the mix looks a little fluffy.

5. Next, blend in the butter, eggs, and sugar. Then sift and blend in the flour, about 1/2 cup at a time.

6. Once the flour is reasonably well incorporated, mix in the baking soda and the vanilla extract.

7. Once everything is well-mixed, add the chocolate chips and gently blend them in.

8. Lightly grease a bread loaf pan (typically around 9 x 5 x 3 in or 21 x 11 x 6 cm) using butter or vegetable oil.

9. Pour your banana bread into the greased bread pan and place it in the oven.

10. Cook the bread until a toothpick comes out clean (ignoring the chocolate). This usually takes somewhere around 30 mins.

11. Once fully cooked, pull the pan out of the oven and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then gently pry the loaf out of the pan; you might want to let it cool for a few more minutes outside of the pan.

11. Enjoy :) It's especially fantastic with a good cup of pourover coffee! I recommend storing leftovers in an airtight container or wrapped tightly in foil or plastic wrap. It will keep on the counter for a couple of days, but you might want to put it in the refrigerator. And heed the warning in note 3,,,

### Notes

`Note 1: You can replace the chocolate chips with chopped nuts, or just skip them if desired.`

`Note 2: Sometimes I cook the banana bread at 375 F, sometimes at 400 F. It varies the cook time and crunchiness of the crust on top, but either way you'll get good results.`

`Note 3: This recipe is apparently so good that my ex--who I never talk to any more--texted me and asked for the recipe. So be wary of making this for your partner ;D`

`Note 4: Sorry I don't have weights for some of the ingredients! I'll make sure to weigh them next time I cook this and add the weights here.`
