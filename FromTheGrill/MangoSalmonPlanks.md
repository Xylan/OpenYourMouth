### Ingredients:

|Ingredients | US    |Metric |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| **Salmon Planks** |
| Salmon fillets | 3, 1/2 - 1 lb each | 225 - 450 g |
| Cedar planks for cooking | 3 | N/A |
| **Sauce** |
| Mango, cubed | 2+ cups | TBA |
| Tequila | 2 oz | 55 ml |
| Lemon juice | 2 tbsp | 30 ml |
| Honey (or sugar) | 1 tbsp | 15 ml |
| **Salsa** |
| Mango, cut into small cubes | 1 cup | TBA |
| Red onion, minced | 1/4 cup | TBA |
| Cilantro, minced | 1/4 cup | TBA |
| Lime juice | 1 tbsp | 15 ml |
| Jalapeños, minced | as desired | N/A |

### Directions:

1. Soak the cedar planks in water for at least half an hour, ideally for a couple of hours.

2. Just before you're ready to put your salmon on the grill, preheat your grill and prepare the sauce. Blend all sauce ingredients, (mango cubes, tequila, lemon juice, and honey), on high until thoroughly puréed.

3. Place the salmon filets on the cedar planks, with one filet on each plank. You can leave the skin on the bottom of the filets. Coat the filets thoroughly with the sauce using a brush, including the sides. If you have extra sauce, you can coat the salmon again as it's cooking.

4. Set your grill to medium heat, then place the salmon planks on your grill. Cook the salmon until it's the desired temperature (at least 145° F, 63° C). This will take around 20 minutes depending on the thickness of your filets, but it's a good idea to check it periodically to keep it from overcooking.

5. While you're cooking the salmon, prepare your salsa. Chop all ingredients as explained in the ingredients list. Then mix them together in a bowl and set the salsa aside.

6. When the salmon is fully cooked, take it off the grill and peel it off of the planks. When plating, you can remove the skin. Once plated, add the salsa to the top of the salmon as desired.

7. Enjoy!

### Notes

`Note 1: I use a four-burner gas grill. This recipe also works with charcoal grills, but be sure to watch the heat and not overcook your salmon.`

`Note 2: The planks will char, and it's ideal to use a fresh plank each time. You might also want to keep a spray bottle with water nearby in case the edges catch on fire, especially if you haven't soaked the planks for very long.`

`Note 3: You should feel free to vary the salsa recipe quantities and ingredients as you desire.`

`Note 4: Sorry I don't have weights for some of the ingredients! I'll make sure to weigh them next time I cook this and add the weights here.`
